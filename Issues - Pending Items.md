### Copy Button for Messages
- **Issue**: Currently, copy buttons are only available in the CommandBar when hovering over messages. This makes it less discoverable and harder to copy message content, especially on mobile devices.
- **Solution**: Add a persistent copy button to each message (both AI and Human messages) that is always visible and easily accessible.
- **Status**: In Progress
